You use WebACLId to get information about a WebACL (see  GetWebACL ), update a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), and delete a WebACL from AWS WAF (see  DeleteWebACL ).\n\nWebACLId is returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .\n\nName -> (string)\n\nA friendly name or description of the WebACL . You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the name of a WebACL after you create it.\nMetricName -> (string)\n\nA friendly name or description for the metrics for this WebACL . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefault_Action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change MetricName after you create the WebACL .\nDefaultAction -> (structure)\n\nThe action to perform if none of the Rules contained in the WebACL match. The action is specified by the  WafAction object.\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\n\n\nRules -> (list)\n\nAn array that contains the action for each Rule in a WebACL , the priority of the Rule , and the ID of the Rule .\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).\nTo specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use the Action parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be consecutive.\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see  UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\n\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by  Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\nSubmit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n\n\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe rule to exclude from a rule group.

Queue names must be unique within each Region.\nGameSessionQueueArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN ) that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name> . In a Amazon GameLift game session queue ARN, the resource ID matches the Name value.\nTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game session placement changes to a TIMED_OUT status. By default, this property is set to 600 .\nPlayerLatencyPolicies -> (list)\n\nA set of policies that act as a sliding cap on player latency. FleetIQ works to deliver low latency for most players in a game session. These policies ensure that no individual player can be placed into a game with unreasonably high latency. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency requirements a step at a time. Multiple policies are applied based on their maximum allowed latency, starting with the lowest value.\n(structure)\n\nSets a latency cap for individual players when placing a game session. With a latency policy in force, a game session cannot be placed in a fleet location where a player reports latency higher than the cap. Latency policies are used only with placement request that provide player latency information. Player latency policies can be stacked to gradually relax latency requirements over time.\nMaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum latency value that is allowed for any player, in milliseconds. All policies must have a value set for this property.\nPolicyDurationSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe length of time, in seconds, that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. A null value for this property means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.\n\n\nDestinations -> (list)\n\nA list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game session placement requests in the queue.

For more information about these statuses, see Understanding command statuses in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide . StatusDetails can be one of the following values:\n\nPending: The command hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been sent to the managed node.\nIn Progress: The command has been sent to the managed node but hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reached a terminal state.\nDelayed: The system attempted to send the command to the target, but the target wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available. The managed node might not be available because of network issues, because the node was stopped, or for similar reasons. The system will try to send the command again.\nSuccess: The command or plugin ran successfully. This is a terminal state.\nDelivery Timed Out: The command wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t delivered to the managed node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count against the parent command\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MaxErrors limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.\nExecution Timed Out: The command started to run on the managed node, but the execution wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complete before the timeout expired. Execution timeouts count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.\nFailed: The command wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run successfully on the managed node. For a plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a terminal state.\nCancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is a terminal state.\nUndeliverable: The command can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be delivered to the managed node. The node might not exist or might not be responding. Undeliverable invocations don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count against the parent command\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MaxErrors limit and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contribute to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.\nTerminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.\n\n",
