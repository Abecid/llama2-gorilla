For more information, see  RegexMatchTuple .\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nIn an  UpdateRegexMatchSet request, RegexMatchSetUpdate specifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple and includes the settings for the RegexMatchTuple .\nAction -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether to insert or delete a  RegexMatchTuple .\nRegexMatchTuple -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect and the identifier of the regular expression (regex) pattern that you want AWS WAF to search for. If you specify DELETE for the value of Action , the RegexMatchTuple values must exactly match the values in the RegexMatchTuple that you want to delete from the RegexMatchSet .\nFieldToMatch -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies where in a web request to look for the RegexPatternSet .\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before inspecting a request for a match.\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\nWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system commandline command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098 ^\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\nt, tab, decimal 9\nn, newline, decimal 10\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than\u00e2\u0080\u009d symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nRegexPatternSetId -> (string)\n\nThe RegexPatternSetId for a RegexPatternSet . You use RegexPatternSetId to get information about a RegexPatternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a RegexPatternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPatternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an RegexPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).\n\nRegexPatternSetId is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .\n\n\n\n",

You use WebACLId to get information about a WebACL (see  GetWebACL ), update a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), and delete a WebACL from AWS WAF (see  DeleteWebACL ).\n\nWebACLId is returned by  CreateWebACL and by  ListWebACLs .\n\nName -> (string)\n\nA friendly name or description of the WebACL . You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the name of a WebACL after you create it.\nMetricName -> (string)\n\nA friendly name or description for the metrics for this WebACL .

It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefault_Action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change MetricName after you create the WebACL .\nDefaultAction -> (structure)\n\nThe action to perform if none of the Rules contained in the WebACL match. The action is specified by the  WafAction object.\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\n\n\nRules -> (list)\n\nAn array that contains the action for each Rule in a WebACL , the priority of the Rule , and the ID of the Rule .\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).\nTo specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use the Action parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be consecutive.\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see  UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\n\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by  Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\nSubmit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n\n\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe rule to exclude from a rule group.

A safety rule can be an assertion rule or a gating rule.\nASSERTION -> (structure)\n\nAn assertion rule enforces that, when a routing control state is changed, the criteria set by the rule configuration is met. Otherwise, the change to the routing control state is not accepted. For example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control state is On after the transaction so that traffic continues to flow to at least one cell for the application. This ensures that you avoid a fail-open scenario.\nAssertedControls -> (list)\n\nThe routing controls that are part of transactions that are evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing control state is allowed. For example, you might include three routing controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.\n(string)\n\nControlPanelArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.\nName -> (string)\n\nName of the assertion rule. You can use any non-white space character in the name.\nRuleConfig -> (structure)\n\nThe criteria that you set for specific assertion routing controls (AssertedControls) that designate how many routing control states must be ON as the result of a transaction. For example, if you have three assertion routing controls, you might specify ATLEAST 2 for your rule configuration. This means that at least two assertion routing control states must be ON, so that at least two Amazon Web Services Regions have traffic flowing to them.\nInverted -> (boolean)\n\nLogical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually evaluate true, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evaluated as false, and vice versa.\nThreshold -> (integer)\n\nThe value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type.

AppConfig supports the following growth types:\n\nLinear : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment time. For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20 initially makes the configuration available to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time has passed, the system updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of the targets are set to receive the deployed configuration.\nExponential : For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment exponentially using the following formula: G*(2^N) . In this formula, G is the growth factor specified by the user and N is the number of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:\n2*(2^0)\n2*(2^1)\n2*(2^2)\n\nExpressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.\nPossible values:\n\nLINEAR\nEXPONENTIAL\n\n"

It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes the Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Services Region, and the job ID. The format of the ARN is as follows:\n\narn:<partition>:comprehend:<region>:<account-id>:targeted-sentiment-detection-job/<job-id>\nThe following is an example job ARN:\n\narn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:targeted-sentiment-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab\n\nJobName -> (string)\n\nThe name that you assigned to the targeted sentiment detection job.\nJobStatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the targeted sentiment detection job. If the status is FAILED , the Messages field shows the reason for the failure.\nMessage -> (string)\n\nA description of the status of a job.\nSubmitTime -> (timestamp)\n\nThe time that the targeted sentiment detection job was submitted for processing.\nEndTime -> (timestamp)\n\nThe time that the targeted sentiment detection job ended.\nInputDataConfig -> (structure)\n\nThe input properties for an inference job. The document reader config field applies only to non-text inputs for custom analysis.\nS3Uri -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The URI must be in same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of data files.\nFor example, if you use the URI S3://bucketName/prefix , if the prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all of them as input.\n\nInputFormat -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how the text in an input file should be processed:\n\nONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific papers.\nONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents, such as text messages.\n\n\nDocumentReaderConfig -> (structure)\n\nProvides configuration parameters to override the default actions for extracting text from PDF documents and image files.\nDocumentReadAction -> (string)\n\nThis field defines the Amazon Textract API operation that Amazon Comprehend uses to extract text from PDF files and image files. Enter one of the following values:\n\nTEXTRACT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_TEXT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the DetectDocumentText API operation.\nTEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT - The Amazon Comprehend service uses the AnalyzeDocument API operation.\n\n\nDocumentReadMode -> (string)\n\nDetermines the text extraction actions for PDF files. Enter one of the following values:\n\nSERVICE_DEFAULT - use the Amazon Comprehend service defaults for PDF files.\nFORCE_DOCUMENT_READ_ACTION - Amazon Comprehend uses the Textract API specified by DocumentReadAction for all PDF files, including digital PDF files.\n\n\nFeatureTypes -> (list)\n\nSpecifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values:\n\nTABLES - Returns information about any tables that are detected in the input document.\nFORMS - Returns information and the data from any forms that are detected in the input document.\n\n(string)\n\nSpecifies the type of Amazon Textract features to apply. If you chose TEXTRACT_ANALYZE_DOCUMENT as the read action, you must specify one or both of the following values:\n\nTABLES - Returns additional information about any tables that are detected in the input document.\nFORMS - Returns additional information about any forms that are detected in the input document.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutputDataConfig -> (structure)\n\nProvides configuration parameters for the output of inference jobs.\nS3Uri -> (string)\n\nWhen you use the OutputDataConfig object with asynchronous operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write the output data. The URI must be in the same Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The location is used as the prefix for the actual location of the output file.\nWhen the topic detection job is finished, the service creates an output file in a directory specific to the job. The S3Uri field contains the location of the output file, called output.tar.gz . It is a compressed archive that contains the ouput of the operation.\nFor a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain text, not a compressed archive. The output file name is the same as the input file, with .out appended at the end.\n\nKmsKeyId -> (string)\n\nID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis job.

The status can have one of the following values:\n\nINVITED - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.\nVERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indicates that Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match, then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, indicates that Detective is verifying that the account belongs to the organization.\nVERIFICATION_FAILED - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the account and email address provided for the member account do not match, and Detective did not send an invitation to the account.\nENABLED - Indicates that the member account currently contributes data to the behavior graph. For invited accounts, the member account accepted the invitation. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account enabled the organization account as a member account.\nACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED - The account accepted the invitation, or was enabled by the Detective administrator account, but is prevented from contributing data to the behavior graph. DisabledReason provides the reason why the member account is not enabled.\n\nInvited accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from the behavior graph are not included. In the organization behavior graph, organization accounts that the Detective administrator account did not enable are not included.\n\nDisabledReason -> (string)\n\nFor member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED , the reason that the member account is not enabled.\nThe reason can have one of the following values:\n\nVOLUME_TOO_HIGH - Indicates that adding the member account would cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high.\nVOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.\n\n\nInvitedTime -> (timestamp)\n\nFor invited accounts, the date and time that Detective sent the invitation to the account.

The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .\nPercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)\n\nThe member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100 percent.\nNote that this is not the percentage of the behavior graph data volume.\nFor example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the data volume for the member account is 40 GB per day, then PercentOfGraphUtilization is 25. It represents 25% of the maximum allowed data volume.\n\nPercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time when the graph utilization percentage was last updated.
