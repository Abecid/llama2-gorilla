This period is required for the queue metadata to reach eventual consistency.\n\nAll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns all values.\nApproximateNumberOfMessages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the approximate number of messages available for retrieval from the queue.\nApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter.\nApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the approximate number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to be in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.\nCreatedTimestamp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the time when the queue was created in seconds (epoch time ).\nDelaySeconds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds.\nLastModifiedTimestamp \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the time when the queue was last changed in seconds (epoch time ).\nMaximumMessageSize \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.\nMessageRetentionPeriod \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. When you change a queue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.\nPolicy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the policy of the queue.\nQueueArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.\nReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive.\nVisibilityTimeout \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the visibility timeout for the queue.

Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.\n\n\nRedriveAllowPolicy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:\nredrivePermission \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The permission type that defines which source queues can specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:\nallowAll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\ndenyAll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\nbyQueue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.\n\n\nsourceQueueArns \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue . You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs. To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll .\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.\nThe following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :\n\nKmsMasterKeyId \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms .\nKmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? .\nSqsManagedSseEnabled \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns information about whether the queue is using SSE-SQS encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).\n\nThe following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues :\n\nFifoQueue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns information about whether the queue is FIFO. For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .\n\n\nNoteTo determine whether a queue is FIFO , you can check whether QueueName ends with the .fifo suffix.\n\nContentBasedDeduplication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Returns whether content-based deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .\n\nThe following attributes apply only to high throughput for FIFO queues :\n\nDeduplicationScope \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue .\nFifoThroughputLimit \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId . The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup .\n\nTo enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:\n\nSet DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .\nSet FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .\n\nIf you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified.\nFor information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .\n(string)\n"

If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

The key prefix is similar to a directory name that enables you to store similar data under the same directory in a bucket.\nKmsKeyArn -> (string)\n\nThe customer master key that Amazon SES should use to encrypt your emails before saving them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the default master key or a custom master key that you created in Amazon Web Services KMS as follows:\n\nTo use the default master key, provide an ARN in the form of arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses . For example, if your Amazon Web Services account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) Region, the ARN of the default master key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses . If you use the default master key, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.\nTo use a custom master key that you created in Amazon Web Services KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your key\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nFor more information about key policies, see the Amazon Web Services KMS Developer Guide . If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES does not encrypt your emails.\n\nWarningYour mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your Amazon Web Services KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with the Amazon Web Services SDK for Java and Amazon Web Services SDK for Ruby only. For more information about client-side encryption using Amazon Web Services KMS master keys, see the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .\n\n\nBounceAction -> (structure)\n\nRejects the received email by returning a bounce response to the sender and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the bounce action is taken.

For more information about Amazon Web Services Lambda, see the Amazon Web Services Lambda Developer Guide .\nInvocationType -> (string)\n\nThe invocation type of the Amazon Web Services Lambda function. An invocation type of RequestResponse means that the execution of the function immediately results in a response, and a value of Event means that the function is invoked asynchronously. The default value is Event . For information about Amazon Web Services Lambda invocation types, see the Amazon Web Services Lambda Developer Guide .\n\nWarningThere is a 30-second timeout on RequestResponse invocations. You should use Event invocation in most cases. Use RequestResponse only to make a mail flow decision, such as whether to stop the receipt rule or the receipt rule set.\n\n\nStopAction -> (structure)\n\nTerminates the evaluation of the receipt rule set and optionally publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.\nScope -> (string)\n\nThe scope of the StopAction. The only acceptable value is RuleSet .\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the stop action is taken.

HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than\u00e2\u0080\u009d symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nRegexPatternSetId -> (string)\n\nThe RegexPatternSetId for a RegexPatternSet . You use RegexPatternSetId to get information about a RegexPatternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ), update a RegexPatternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPatternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an RegexPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).\n\nRegexPatternSetId is returned by  CreateRegexPatternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .\n\n\n\n",

Each item in MetricDataQueries gets a metric or performs a math expression. One item in MetricDataQueries is the expression that provides the time series that the anomaly detector uses as input. Designate the expression by setting ReturnData to true for this object in the array. For all other expressions and metrics, set ReturnData to false . The designated expression must return a single time series.\n(structure)\n\nThis structure is used in both GetMetricData and PutMetricAlarm . The supported use of this structure is different for those two operations.\nWhen used in GetMetricData , it indicates the metric data to return, and whether this call is just retrieving a batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Metrics Insights query or a math expression. A single GetMetricData call can include up to 500 MetricDataQuery structures.\nWhen used in PutMetricAlarm , it enables you to create an alarm based on a metric math expression. Each MetricDataQuery in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve, or a math expression to be performed on retrieved metrics. A single PutMetricAlarm call can include up to 20 MetricDataQuery structures in the array. The 20 structures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as 10 structures that contain the Expression parameter to perform a math expression. Of those Expression structures, one must have true as the value for ReturnData . The result of this expression is the value the alarm watches.\nAny expression used in a PutMetricAlarm operation must return a single time series. For more information, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .\nSome of the parameters of this structure also have different uses whether you are using this structure in a GetMetricData operation or a PutMetricAlarm operation. These differences are explained in the following parameter list.\nId -> (string)\n\nA short name used to tie this object to the results in the response. This name must be unique within a single call to GetMetricData . If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter.\nMetricStat -> (structure)\n\nThe metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. Use this parameter only if this object is retrieving a metric and not performing a math expression on returned data.\nWithin one MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.\nMetric -> (structure)\n\nThe metric to return, including the metric name, namespace, and dimensions.\nNamespace -> (string)\n\nThe namespace of the metric.\nMetricName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the metric. This is a required field.\nDimensions -> (list)\n\nThe dimensions for the metric.\n(structure)\n\nA dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.\nYou can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only ASCII characters, must include at least one non-whitespace character, and cannot start with a colon (: ). ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension names.\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe value of the dimension. Dimension values must contain only ASCII characters and must include at least one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters are not supported as part of dimension values.\n\n\n\nPeriod -> (integer)\n\nThe granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.\nIf the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:\n\nStart time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).\nStart time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).\nStart time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).\n\n\nStat -> (string)\n\nThe statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic.\nUnit -> (string)\n\nWhen you are using a Put operation, this defines what unit you want to use when storing the metric.\nIn a Get operation, if you omit Unit then all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.\n\n\nExpression -> (string)\n\nThis field can contain either a Metrics Insights query, or a metric math expression to be performed on the returned data. For more information about Metrics Insights queries, see Metrics Insights query components and syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .\nA math expression can use the Id of the other metrics or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use the Id of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. For more information about metric math expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .\nWithin each MetricDataQuery object, you must specify either Expression or MetricStat but not both.\n\nLabel -> (string)\n\nA human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is an expression, so that you know what the value represents. If the metric or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard widget, the label is shown. If Label is omitted, CloudWatch generates a default.\nYou can put dynamic expressions into a label, so that it is more descriptive. For more information, see Using Dynamic Labels .\n\nReturnData -> (boolean)\n\nWhen used in GetMetricData , this option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you are performing this call just to do math expressions and do not also need the raw data returned, you can specify false . If you omit this, the default of true is used.\nWhen used in PutMetricAlarm , specify true for the one expression result to use as the alarm. For all other metrics and expressions in the same PutMetricAlarm operation, specify ReturnData as False.\n\nPeriod -> (integer)\n\nThe granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData operation that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second .\nAccountId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the account where the metrics are located.\nIf you are performing a GetMetricData operation in a monitoring account, use this to specify which account to retrieve this metric from.\nIf you are performing a PutMetricAlarm operation, use this to specify which account contains the metric that the alarm is watching.\n\n\n\n"

Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\n\n\nRules -> (list)\n\nAn array that contains the action for each Rule in a WebACL , the priority of the Rule , and the ID of the Rule .\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).\nTo specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use the Action parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to be consecutive.\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see  UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\n\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by  Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\nSubmit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n\n\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe rule to exclude from a rule group.

Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call  GetRecords in a loop. Use  GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to specify in the first  GetRecords call.  GetRecords returns a new shard iterator in NextShardIterator . Specify the shard iterator returned in NextShardIterator in subsequent calls to  GetRecords . If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return more data and  GetRecords returns null in NextShardIterator . You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.The size of the data returned by  GetRecords varies depending on the utilization of the shard. It is recommended that consumer applications retrieve records via the GetRecords command using the 5 TPS limit to remain caught up. Retrieving records less frequently can lead to consumer applications falling behind. The maximum size of data that  GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException . If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException .  GetRecords doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to  GetRecords . However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, ApproximateArrivalTimestamp , that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with  PutRecords ). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.See also: AWS API Documentation\n",

For more information, see  FieldToMatch .\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\n\nTargetString -> (blob)\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string in the part of web requests that you specified in FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.\nValid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch :\n\nHEADER : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.\nURI : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nIf TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the AWS WAF API\nSpecify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.\nFor example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of TargetString .\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on FieldToMatch before inspecting it for a match.\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\nWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098 ^\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\nt, tab, decimal 9\nn, newline, decimal 10\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than\u00e2\u0080\u009d symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nPositionalConstraint -> (string)\n\nWithin the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the following:\n\nCONTAINS\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , but the location doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter.\n\nCONTAINS_WORD\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , and TargetString must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString must be a word, which means one of the following:\n\nTargetString exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header.\nTargetString is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, BadBot; .\nTargetString is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ;BadBot .\nTargetString is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for example, -BadBot; .\n\n\nEXACTLY\nThe value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of TargetString .\n\nSTARTS_WITH\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.\n\nENDS_WITH\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.\n\n\n\n",

A safety rule can be an assertion rule or a gating rule.\nASSERTION -> (structure)\n\nAn assertion rule enforces that, when a routing control state is changed, the criteria set by the rule configuration is met. Otherwise, the change to the routing control state is not accepted. For example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control state is On after the transaction so that traffic continues to flow to at least one cell for the application. This ensures that you avoid a fail-open scenario.\nAssertedControls -> (list)\n\nThe routing controls that are part of transactions that are evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing control state is allowed. For example, you might include three routing controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.\n(string)\n\nControlPanelArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.\nName -> (string)\n\nName of the assertion rule. You can use any non-white space character in the name.\nRuleConfig -> (structure)\n\nThe criteria that you set for specific assertion routing controls (AssertedControls) that designate how many routing control states must be ON as the result of a transaction. For example, if you have three assertion routing controls, you might specify ATLEAST 2 for your rule configuration. This means that at least two assertion routing control states must be ON, so that at least two Amazon Web Services Regions have traffic flowing to them.\nInverted -> (boolean)\n\nLogical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually evaluate true, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evaluated as false, and vice versa.\nThreshold -> (integer)\n\nThe value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type. That is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when you specify an ATLEAST type.\nType -> (string)\n\nA rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.\n\nSafetyRuleArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the assertion rule.\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe deployment status of an assertion rule. Status can be one of the following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.\nWaitPeriodMs -> (integer)\n\nAn evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request against the target routing controls will fail. This helps prevent \u00e2\u0080\u009cflapping\u00e2\u0080\u009d of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by default, but you can choose a custom value.\n\nGATING -> (structure)\n\nA gating rule verifies that a gating routing control or set of gating routing controls, evaluates as true, based on a rule configuration that you specify, which allows a set of routing control state changes to complete.\nFor example, if you specify one gating routing control and you set the Type in the rule configuration to OR, that indicates that you must set the gating routing control to On for the rule to evaluate as true; that is, for the gating control \u00e2\u0080\u009cswitch\u00e2\u0080\u009d to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn\u00e2\u0080\u009d. When you do that, then you can update the routing control states for the target routing controls that you specify in the gating rule.\nControlPanelArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.\nGatingControls -> (list)\n\nAn array of gating routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). For a simple \u00e2\u0080\u009con/off\u00e2\u0080\u009d switch, specify the ARN for one routing control. The gating routing controls are evaluated by the rule configuration that you specify to determine if the target routing control states can be changed.\n(string)\n\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name for the gating rule. You can use any non-white space character in the name.\nRuleConfig -> (structure)\n\nThe criteria that you set for gating routing controls that designate how many of the routing control states must be ON to allow you to update target routing control states.\nInverted -> (boolean)\n\nLogical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually evaluate true, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evaluated as false, and vice versa.\nThreshold -> (integer)\n\nThe value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type. That is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when you specify an ATLEAST type.\nType -> (string)\n\nA rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.\n\nSafetyRuleArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gating rule.\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe deployment status of a gating rule. Status can be one of the following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.\nTargetControls -> (list)\n\nAn array of target routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for which the states can only be updated if the rule configuration that you specify evaluates to true for the gating routing control. As a simple example, if you have a single gating control, it acts as an overall \u00e2\u0080\u009con/off\u00e2\u0080\u009d switch for a set of target routing controls. You can use this to manually override automated failover, for example.\n(string)\n\nWaitPeriodMs -> (integer)\n\nAn evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request against the target routing controls will fail. This helps prevent \u00e2\u0080\u009cflapping\u00e2\u0080\u009d of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by default, but you can choose a custom value.\n\n\n"

For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out the configuration as follows:\n2*(2^0)\n2*(2^1)\n2*(2^2)\n\nExpressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the configuration has been deployed to all targets.\nPossible values:\n\nLINEAR\nEXPONENTIAL\n\n"

By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.\nTracingConfig \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Tracing mode of an Amazon SNS topic. By default TracingConfig is set to PassThrough , and the topic passes through the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its subscriptions. If set to Active , Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray segment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the tracing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.\nHTTP\nHTTPSuccessFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\nHTTPSuccessFeedbackSampleRate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\nHTTPFailureFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.\n\n\nAmazon Kinesis Data Firehose\nFirehoseSuccessFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.\nFirehoseSuccessFeedbackSampleRate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.\nFirehoseFailureFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.\n\n\nLambda\nLambdaSuccessFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\nLambdaSuccessFeedbackSampleRate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\nLambdaFailureFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.\n\n\nPlatform application endpoint\nApplicationSuccessFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.\nApplicationSuccessFeedbackSampleRate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.\nApplicationFailureFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nNoteIn addition to being able to configure topic attributes for message delivery status of notification messages sent to Amazon SNS application endpoints, you can also configure application attributes for the delivery status of push notification messages sent to push notification services.\nFor example, For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Application Attributes for Message Delivery Status .\n\n\nAmazon SQS\nSQSSuccessFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\nSQSSuccessFeedbackSampleRate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\nSQSFailureFeedbackRoleArn \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe <ENDPOINT>SuccessFeedbackRoleArn and <ENDPOINT>FailureFeedbackRoleArn attributes are used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf. The <ENDPOINT>SuccessFeedbackSampleRate attribute is for specifying the sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages. After you configure the <ENDPOINT>FailureFeedbackRoleArn attribute, then all failed message deliveries generate CloudWatch Logs.\nThe following attribute applies only to server-side-encryption :\n\nKmsMasterKeyId \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference .\nSignatureVersion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The signature version corresponds to the hashing algorithm used while creating the signature of the notifications, subscription confirmations, or unsubscribe confirmation messages sent by Amazon SNS. By default, SignatureVersion is set to 1 .\n\nThe following attribute applies only to FIFO topics :\n\nContentBasedDeduplication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.\nBy default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false . If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false , you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.\nWhen you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true , Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.\n\n\n\n",

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nSpecifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  SizeConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for each object, indicates whether you want to negate the settings, for example, requests that do NOT originate from the IP address 192.0.2.44.\nNegated -> (boolean)\n\nSet Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block, or count requests based on the settings in the specified  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeConstraintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or block requests based on that IP address.\nSet Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block a request based on the negation of the settings in the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,  SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  XssMatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , or  SizeConstraintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP address 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow, block, or count requests based on all IP addresses except 192.0.2.44 .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe type of predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or IPSet .\nDataId -> (string)\n\nA unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatchSetId or IPSetId . The ID is returned by the corresponding Create or List command.\n\n\nRateKey -> (string)\n\nThe field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The only valid value for RateKey is IP . IP indicates that requests arriving from the same IP address are subject to the RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule .\nRateLimit -> (long)\n\nThe maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the field specified by the RateKey , allowed in a five-minute period. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and the other predicates specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the action that is specified for this rule.\n"

For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters) that you want AWS WAF to search for in web requests, the location in requests that you want AWS WAF to search, and other settings.\nFieldToMatch -> (structure)\n\nThe part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to search, such as a specified header or a query string. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\n\nTargetString -> (blob)\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string in the part of web requests that you specified in FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.\nValid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch :\n\nHEADER : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in  FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\nQUERY_STRING : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.\nURI : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nIf TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the AWS WAF API\nSpecify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.\nFor example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of TargetString .\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on FieldToMatch before inspecting it for a match.\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\nWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: \u00e2\u0080\u009c \u00e2\u0080\u0098 ^\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\nt, tab, decimal 9\nn, newline, decimal 10\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cless than\u00e2\u0080\u009d symbol\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\n\nLOWERCASE\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\nSpecify NONE if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nPositionalConstraint -> (string)\n\nWithin the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the following:\n\nCONTAINS\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , but the location doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter.\n\nCONTAINS_WORD\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , and TargetString must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString must be a word, which means one of the following:\n\nTargetString exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header.\nTargetString is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, BadBot; .\nTargetString is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ;BadBot .\nTargetString is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for example, -BadBot; .\n\n\nEXACTLY\nThe value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of TargetString .\n\nSTARTS_WITH\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.\n\nENDS_WITH\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.\n\n\n\n",

The ID is guaranteed to be unique and does not change.\nName -> (string)\n\nA user-defined name for the machine learning transform. Names are not guaranteed unique and can be changed at any time.\nDescription -> (string)\n\nA user-defined, long-form description text for the machine learning transform. Descriptions are not guaranteed to be unique and can be changed at any time.\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the machine learning transform.\nCreatedOn -> (timestamp)\n\nA timestamp. The time and date that this machine learning transform was created.\nLastModifiedOn -> (timestamp)\n\nA timestamp. The last point in time when this machine learning transform was modified.\nInputRecordTables -> (list)\n\nA list of Glue table definitions used by the transform.\n(structure)\n\nThe database and table in the Glue Data Catalog that is used for input or output data.\nDatabaseName -> (string)\n\nA database name in the Glue Data Catalog.\nTableName -> (string)\n\nA table name in the Glue Data Catalog.\nCatalogId -> (string)\n\nA unique identifier for the Glue Data Catalog.\nConnectionName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the connection to the Glue Data Catalog.\nAdditionalOptions -> (map)\n\nAdditional options for the table. Currently there are two keys supported:\n\npushDownPredicate : to filter on partitions without having to list and read all the files in your dataset.\ncatalogPartitionPredicate : to use server-side partition pruning using partition indexes in the Glue Data Catalog.\n\nkey -> (string)\nvalue -> (string)\n\n\n\nParameters -> (structure)\n\nA TransformParameters object. You can use parameters to tune (customize) the behavior of the machine learning transform by specifying what data it learns from and your preference on various tradeoffs (such as precious vs. recall, or accuracy vs. cost).\nTransformType -> (string)\n\nThe type of machine learning transform.\nFor information about the types of machine learning transforms, see Creating Machine Learning Transforms .\n\nFindMatchesParameters -> (structure)\n\nThe parameters for the find matches algorithm.\nPrimaryKeyColumnName -> (string)\n\nThe name of a column that uniquely identifies rows in the source table. Used to help identify matching records.\nPrecisionRecallTradeoff -> (double)\n\nThe value selected when tuning your transform for a balance between precision and recall. A value of 0.5 means no preference; a value of 1.0 means a bias purely for precision, and a value of 0.0 means a bias for recall. Because this is a tradeoff, choosing values close to 1.0 means very low recall, and choosing values close to 0.0 results in very low precision.\nThe precision metric indicates how often your model is correct when it predicts a match.\nThe recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your model predicts the match.\n\nAccuracyCostTradeoff -> (double)\n\nThe value that is selected when tuning your transform for a balance between accuracy and cost. A value of 0.5 means that the system balances accuracy and cost concerns. A value of 1.0 means a bias purely for accuracy, which typically results in a higher cost, sometimes substantially higher. A value of 0.0 means a bias purely for cost, which results in a less accurate FindMatches transform, sometimes with unacceptable accuracy.\nAccuracy measures how well the transform finds true positives and true negatives. Increasing accuracy requires more machine resources and cost. But it also results in increased recall.\nCost measures how many compute resources, and thus money, are consumed to run the transform.\n\nEnforceProvidedLabels -> (boolean)\n\nThe value to switch on or off to force the output to match the provided labels from users. If the value is True , the find matches transform forces the output to match the provided labels. The results override the normal conflation results. If the value is False , the find matches transform does not ensure all the labels provided are respected, and the results rely on the trained model.\nNote that setting this value to true may increase the conflation execution time.\n\n\n\nEvaluationMetrics -> (structure)\n\nAn EvaluationMetrics object. Evaluation metrics provide an estimate of the quality of your machine learning transform.\nTransformType -> (string)\n\nThe type of machine learning transform.\nFindMatchesMetrics -> (structure)\n\nThe evaluation metrics for the find matches algorithm.\nAreaUnderPRCurve -> (double)\n\nThe area under the precision/recall curve (AUPRC) is a single number measuring the overall quality of the transform, that is independent of the choice made for precision vs. recall. Higher values indicate that you have a more attractive precision vs. recall tradeoff.\nFor more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.\n\nPrecision -> (double)\n\nThe precision metric indicates when often your transform is correct when it predicts a match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total true positives possible.\nFor more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.\n\nRecall -> (double)\n\nThe recall metric indicates that for an actual match, how often your transform predicts the match. Specifically, it measures how well the transform finds true positives from the total records in the source data.\nFor more information, see Precision and recall in Wikipedia.\n\nF1 -> (double)\n\nThe maximum F1 metric indicates the transform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accuracy between 0 and 1, where 1 is the best accuracy.\nFor more information, see F1 score in Wikipedia.\n\nConfusionMatrix -> (structure)\n\nThe confusion matrix shows you what your transform is predicting accurately and what types of errors it is making.\nFor more information, see Confusion matrix in Wikipedia.\nNumTruePositives -> (long)\n\nThe number of matches in the data that the transform correctly found, in the confusion matrix for your transform.\nNumFalsePositives -> (long)\n\nThe number of nonmatches in the data that the transform incorrectly classified as a match, in the confusion matrix for your transform.\nNumTrueNegatives -> (long)\n\nThe number of nonmatches in the data that the transform correctly rejected, in the confusion matrix for your transform.\nNumFalseNegatives -> (long)\n\nThe number of matches in the data that the transform didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find, in the confusion matrix for your transform.\n\nColumnImportances -> (list)\n\nA list of ColumnImportance structures containing column importance metrics, sorted in order of descending importance.\n(structure)\n\nA structure containing the column name and column importance score for a column.\nColumn importance helps you understand how columns contribute to your model, by identifying which columns in your records are more important than others.\nColumnName -> (string)\n\nThe name of a column.\nImportance -> (double)\n\nThe column importance score for the column, as a decimal.\n\n\n\n\nLabelCount -> (integer)\n\nA count identifier for the labeling files generated by Glue for this transform. As you create a better transform, you can iteratively download, label, and upload the labeling file.\nSchema -> (list)\n\nA map of key-value pairs representing the columns and data types that this transform can run against. Has an upper bound of 100 columns.\n(structure)\n\nA key-value pair representing a column and data type that this transform can run against. The Schema parameter of the MLTransform may contain up to 100 of these structures.\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the column.\nDataType -> (string)\n\nThe type of data in the column.\n\n\nRole -> (string)\n\nThe name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role with the required permissions. The required permissions include both Glue service role permissions to Glue resources, and Amazon S3 permissions required by the transform.\n\nThis role needs Glue service role permissions to allow access to resources in Glue. See Attach a Policy to IAM Users That Access Glue .\nThis role needs permission to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) sources, targets, temporary directory, scripts, and any libraries used by the task run for this transform.\n\n\nGlueVersion -> (string)\n\nThis value determines which version of Glue this machine learning transform is compatible with. Glue 1.0 is recommended for most customers. If the value is not set, the Glue compatibility defaults to Glue 0.9. For more information, see Glue Versions in the developer guide.\nMaxCapacity -> (double)\n\nThe number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that are allocated to task runs for this transform. You can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs; the default is 10. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the Glue pricing page .\n\nMaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers and WorkerType .\n\nIf either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity cannot be set.\nIf MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType can be set.\nIf WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).\nMaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.\n\nWhen the WorkerType field is set to a value other than Standard , the MaxCapacity field is set automatically and becomes read-only.\n\nWorkerType -> (string)\n\nThe type of predefined worker that is allocated when a task of this transform runs. Accepts a value of Standard, G.1X, or G.2X.\n\nFor the Standard worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 50GB disk, and 2 executors per worker.\nFor the G.1X worker type, each worker provides 4 vCPU, 16 GB of memory and a 64GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.\nFor the G.2X worker type, each worker provides 8 vCPU, 32 GB of memory and a 128GB disk, and 1 executor per worker.\n\n\nMaxCapacity is a mutually exclusive option with NumberOfWorkers and WorkerType .\n\nIf either NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType is set, then MaxCapacity cannot be set.\nIf MaxCapacity is set then neither NumberOfWorkers or WorkerType can be set.\nIf WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).\nMaxCapacity and NumberOfWorkers must both be at least 1.\n\n\nNumberOfWorkers -> (integer)\n\nThe number of workers of a defined workerType that are allocated when a task of the transform runs.\nIf WorkerType is set, then NumberOfWorkers is required (and vice versa).\n\nTimeout -> (integer)\n\nThe timeout in minutes of the machine learning transform.\nMaxRetries -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum number of times to retry after an MLTaskRun of the machine learning transform fails.\nTransformEncryption -> (structure)\n\nThe encryption-at-rest settings of the transform that apply to accessing user data.

This field is visible only to the creator of the HIT.\nQualificationRequirements -> (list)\n\nConditions that a Worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Qualifications must meet in order to accept the HIT. A HIT can have between zero and ten Qualification requirements. All requirements must be met in order for a Worker to accept the HIT. Additionally, other actions can be restricted using the ActionsGuarded field on each QualificationRequirement structure.\n(structure)\n\nThe QualificationRequirement data structure describes a Qualification that a Worker must have before the Worker is allowed to accept a HIT. A requirement may optionally state that a Worker must have the Qualification in order to preview the HIT, or see the HIT in search results.\nQualificationTypeId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the Qualification type for the requirement.\nComparator -> (string)\n\nThe kind of comparison to make against a Qualification\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value. You can compare a Qualification\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value to an IntegerValue to see if it is LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the IntegerValue. You can compare it to a LocaleValue to see if it is EqualTo, or NotEqualTo the LocaleValue. You can check to see if the value is In or NotIn a set of IntegerValue or LocaleValue values. Lastly, a Qualification requirement can also test if a Qualification Exists or DoesNotExist in the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile, regardless of its value.\nIntegerValues -> (list)\n\nThe integer value to compare against the Qualification\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value. IntegerValue must not be present if Comparator is Exists or DoesNotExist. IntegerValue can only be used if the Qualification type has an integer value; it cannot be used with the Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 15 IntegerValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.\n(integer)\n\nLocaleValues -> (list)\n\nThe locale value to compare against the Qualification\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value. The local value must be a valid ISO 3166 country code or supports ISO 3166-2 subdivisions. LocaleValue can only be used with a Worker_Locale QualificationType ID. LocaleValue can only be used with the EqualTo, NotEqualTo, In, and NotIn comparators. You must only use a single LocaleValue element when using the EqualTo or NotEqualTo comparators. When performing a set comparison by using the In or the NotIn comparator, you can use up to 30 LocaleValue elements in a QualificationRequirement data structure.\n(structure)\n\nThe Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.\nCountry -> (string)\n\nThe country of the locale. Must be a valid ISO 3166 country code. For example, the code US refers to the United States of America.\nSubdivision -> (string)\n\nThe state or subdivision of the locale. A valid ISO 3166-2 subdivision code. For example, the code WA refers to the state of Washington.\n\n\nRequiredToPreview -> (boolean)\n\nDEPRECATED: Use the ActionsGuarded field instead. If RequiredToPreview is true, the question data for the HIT will not be shown when a Worker whose Qualifications do not meet this requirement tries to preview the HIT. That is, a Worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Qualifications must meet all of the requirements for which RequiredToPreview is true in order to preview the HIT. If a Worker meets all of the requirements where RequiredToPreview is true (or if there are no such requirements), but does not meet all of the requirements for the HIT, the Worker will be allowed to preview the HIT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question data, but will not be allowed to accept and complete the HIT. The default is false. This should not be used in combination with the ActionsGuarded field.\nActionsGuarded -> (string)\n\nSetting this attribute prevents Workers whose Qualifications do not meet this QualificationRequirement from taking the specified action. Valid arguments include \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccept\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Worker cannot accept the HIT, but can preview the HIT and see it in their search results), \u00e2\u0080\u009cPreviewAndAccept\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Worker cannot accept or preview the HIT, but can see the HIT in their search results), and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiscoverPreviewAndAccept\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Worker cannot accept, preview, or see the HIT in their search results). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for you to create a HIT with multiple QualificationRequirements (which can have different values for the ActionGuarded attribute). In this case, the Worker is only permitted to perform an action when they have met all QualificationRequirements guarding the action. The actions in the order of least restrictive to most restrictive are Discover, Preview and Accept. For example, if a Worker meets all QualificationRequirements that are set to DiscoverPreviewAndAccept, but do not meet all requirements that are set with PreviewAndAccept, then the Worker will be able to Discover, i.e. see the HIT in their search result, but will not be able to Preview or Accept the HIT. ActionsGuarded should not be used in combination with the RequiredToPreview field.\n\n\nHITReviewStatus -> (string)\n\nIndicates the review status of the HIT. Valid Values are NotReviewed | MarkedForReview | ReviewedAppropriate | ReviewedInappropriate.\nNumberOfAssignmentsPending -> (integer)\n\nThe number of assignments for this HIT that are being previewed or have been accepted by Workers, but have not yet been submitted, returned, or abandoned.\nNumberOfAssignmentsAvailable -> (integer)\n\nThe number of assignments for this HIT that are available for Workers to accept.\nNumberOfAssignmentsCompleted -> (integer)\n\nThe number of assignments for this HIT that have been approved or rejected.\n"

However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using  GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL .

The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\nSubmit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n\n\n(structure)\n\n\nNoteThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation.

Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.\nEndpointId -> (string)\n\nAn ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.\nAn Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.\n\nWeight -> (integer)\n\nThe weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see Endpoint weights in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\nHealthState -> (string)\n\nThe health status of the endpoint.\nHealthReason -> (string)\n\nReturns a null result.\nClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.\nIf the value is set to true, the client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IP address is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic travels to applications on the endpoint fronted by the accelerator.\nClient IP address preservation is supported, in specific Amazon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that are Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, and Network Load Balancers with Security Groups. IMPORTANT: You cannot use client IP address preservation with Network Load Balancers with TLS listeners.\nFor more information, see Preserve client IP addresses in Global Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\n\n\nTrafficDialPercentage -> (float)\n\nThe percentage of traffic to send to an Amazon Web Services Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.\nUse this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.\nThe default value is 100.\n\nHealthCheckPort -> (integer)\n\nThe port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.\nThe default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.\n\nHealthCheckProtocol -> (string)\n\nThe protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.\nHealthCheckPath -> (string)\n\nIf the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).\nHealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe time\u00e2\u0080\u009410 seconds or 30 seconds\u00e2\u0080\u0094between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.\nThresholdCount -> (integer)\n\nThe number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.\nPortOverrides -> (list)\n\nAllows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on.\n(structure)\n\nOverride specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.\nFor more information, see Overriding listener ports in the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\nListenerPort -> (integer)\n\nThe listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.\nEndpointPort -> (integer)\n\nThe endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.\n\n\n"
